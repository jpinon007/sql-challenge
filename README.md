# sql-challenge
# Background : As a newly hired data engineer, I had to design tables to hold data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and analyze the data.

# Solution : In order to complete the assignment, I did seek out help from my tutor Fred and used the professor's solution as guidance https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Northwestern-University/NU-VIRT-DATA-PT-06-2024-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/Homework/09-SQL/Solutions?ref_type=heads , as well as asking for assistance during office hours.

 # Data Engineering: I began by creating my repo and downloading necessary csv files. I created a table schema for each respective csv file, being mindful of the data type, primary keys, foreign keys, and other restraints. Next, I imported each csv file into its appropriate SQL table. 

 # Data Analysis : I was asked to do the following -
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
